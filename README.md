# MEAN Twitter Clone

A simple twitter clone created while working through Microsoft Virtual Academy's MEAN Stack Jump Start course. The application was built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS (1.X), and Node.js). A live demo can be found [here](https://mean-twitter-clone.herokuapp.com)

## Required Software

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* NPM (Comes with Node.js)
* [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com)

## Database Setup

1.  Download and install the MongoDB Community Server for your specific OS.

2.  From the terminal, start the MongoDB server by running either the `mongod` command or `./mongod` from the `mongo/bin` directory. A custom data directory can be specified by adding the `--dbpath <path>` flag to the `mongod` command.

## Instructions

1.  After downloading or cloning this repository, open a terminal window and navigate to the installation directory.

2.  Run `npm install` to install the required NPM dependencies.

3.  Run `npm start` to start the server. The server should now be running.

4.  Finally, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
